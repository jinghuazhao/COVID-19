Hi Jing Hua,

Here's the omicsMap file and the INTERVAL data released for flagship.

/rds/user/ps629/rds-jmmh2-projects/interval_flagship/data_management_files/batch4_updated/omicsMap.csv
/rds/user/ps629/rds-jmmh2-projects/interval_flagship/data_management_files/batch4_updated/INTERVALdata_28FEB2020.csv

Please note that the omicsMap file should be used with the INTERVAL data from the same release since the order of individuals change between releases.

And the WES and WGS data released by Sanger are here -

~/rds/rds-jmmh2-post_qc_data/interval/genotype/wgs/chr[1:22]/chr[1:22]_intervalwgs_v2_GT_only.vcf.bgz
~/rds/rds-jmmh2-post_qc_data/interval/genotype/wes/WES_QCed_Info_updated_4006_FINAL.vcf.gz

Please let me know if you don't have access to any of these files or if you have any questions.

Best wishes,
Praveen.

Hi both,
 
Eleâ€™s group has circulated another Doodle poll for meeting about the details and deadlines-- I am wondering shall we get from the data management team the sample ID linkage between Olink proteomics data and WES/WGS so I could at least do the analysis casually (with the SCALLOP analysis here) and in line with other teams and if I miss out anything about the genetic data Praveen can point it out.
 
Thanks and good weekend,
 
 
Jing Hua

Dear Praveen,
 
This is a follow-up of the conversation regarding the consortium effort above in attachments recently received (possibly ~/rds/post_qc_data/interval/genotype/wes/|wgs?) and record linkage with Olink panels. It appears you have already deposited the first group at wgs/wgs_exonic/. Any advice to proceed will be greatly appreciated.
 
Also related to the SCALLOP/INF work, we made attempts to pair pQTLs/proxies with immune related diseases through PhenoScanner/literature and are keen to formal colocalisation using available summary statistics and you are recommended as an invaluable resource so hopefully can be in touch as well.
 
Best wishes,
 
 
Jing Hua
